## /Playing with LEDs/
<h3>📃About:</h3>
I created it while i was studying more about how the arduino stuff works, and used the components that i bought, testing and playing with it.
It's pretty simple, but it works for learn more about and, meanwhile, it's fun.<br>
The code is all documented and it have the section <i>MAIN CONFIGS</i>, which you can configure all the project the way you want by changing only that section.

<h3>⚙️Components used:</h3>
· Arduino UNO R3.<br>
· Protoboard 400 Points.<br>
· Push-Button.<br>
· 10 Jumper wires.<br>
· 7 LEDs (2G, 3Y, 2R).<br>
· 7 Resistors (330Ω).<br>

<h3>🔌Circuit:</h3>

I used Tinkercad (tinkercad.com) to test the code online and to get the diagram/image of the circuit.
